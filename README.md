### Hi there 👋

- 🧑‍💻 I'm a Software Engineer working at [CoinDCX](https://coindcx.com/), building the mobile application.
- ✨ I love building amazing products through code.
- 🌍 I'm looking to collaborate on Open Source projects. I'm currently working on a package called [smart_textfield](https://github.com/Yogi-7y/Project-Y/tree/main/packages/smart_textfield).
- ✏️ I often share my experience through [blogs](https://yogi-7y.medium.com/).
- 🎓 I'm exploring Go & Functional Programming and have a couple of [blogs](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/functional-programming-in-dart-foundation-part-0-7e932517b824) on it.
